//Suppose you have a sorted array of infinite numbers, how would you search an element in the array?
//Source: Amazon Interview Experience.
//Since array is sorted, the first thing clicks into mind is binary search, but the problem here is
// that we donâ€™t know size of array.
//If the array is infinite, that means we donâ€™t have proper bounds to apply binary search. So in order
// to find position of key, first we find bounds and then apply binary search algorithm.
//Let low be pointing to 1st element and high pointing to 2nd element of array, Now compare key with high index element,
//->if it is greater than high index element then copy high index in low index and double the high index.
//->if it is smaller, then apply binary search on high and low indices found.
